			<div class="shortinfo">
				<p>Amidst all the glamourous attractions built by spending a crazy amount of money, there on a snowy night in Iceland or among the pastel-coloured homes in Norway appears the most beautiful thing on planet earth — that’s purely nature’s work! Now if the Northern Lights aren’t deemed beautiful, I don’t know what is.</p>

				<h3>WHAT ARE NORTHERN LIGHTS?</h3>
				<p>The bright dancing lights of the aurora are actually collisions between electrically charged particles from the sun that enter the earth's atmosphere. The lights are seen above the magnetic poles of the northern and southern hemispheres. They are known as 'Aurora borealis' in the north and 'Aurora australis' in the south..
				Auroral displays appear in many colours although pale green and pink are the most common. Shades of red, yellow, green, blue, and violet have been reported. The lights appear in many forms from patches or scattered clouds of light to streamers, arcs, rippling curtains or shooting rays that light up the sky with an eerie glow.</p>

				<h3>WHAT CAUSES THE NORTHERN LIGHTS?</h3>
				<p>The Northern Lights are actually the result of collisions between gaseous particles in the Earth's atmosphere with charged particles released from the sun's atmosphere. Variations in colour are due to the type of gas particles that are colliding. The most common auroral color, a pale yellowish-green, is produced by oxygen molecules located about 60 miles above the earth. Rare, all-red auroras are produced by high-altitude oxygen, at heights of up to 200 miles. Nitrogen produces blue or purplish-red aurora.</p>

				<h3>What is the northern lights oval?</h3>
				<p>The northern lights oval is the zone, where the magnetic shield gets weaker and the particles can "fall down" towards the earth. Typically the auroral zone is 10° to 20° from the magnetic pole at northern or southern latitudes from 50° to 80°.
				In geomagnetic storms the auroral zone expands to lower latitudes.</p>

				<h3>The Aurora Oval & Ovation Map</h3>
				<p>The Ovation map is created using real time data about solar winds and the interplanetary magnetic field to provide a 30 to 40 minute forecast as to locations from where the Aurora may be visible. The model also tells us the strength of the predicted Aurora and it is important to point out that it represents the Auroral Oval as seen from directly overhead. Standing on the Earth and looking north, the oval will be visible further south than it appears on the overhead image.</p>

				<a name="FAQ"></a>
				<h3>Where is the best place to go and see the northern lights?</h3>
				<p>The best places in the world are usually closer to the Arctic Circle, including Alaska, Canada, Iceland, Greenland, Norway, Sweden and Finland. But don't limit yourself: You can also spot the southern lights in the southern hemisphere. Still, the northern lights are the star of the show.</p>
			</div>	

		
			<div class = "about">
				<h3>What month is best to see the northern lights?</h3>
				<p>Since it does need to be dark in order to see the Northern Lights in the sky, late August/September through the very beginning of April is the best time to go to a destination located in the aurora zone for a chance to see them.</p>
			</div>
		
		
		
			<div class = "about">
				<h3>Can you see northern lights with naked eyes?</h3>
				<p>Our naked eye can most easily see the green-yellow part of the spectrum where the sun emits most of its light. Green is the most common color observed but the Northern Lights can also appear white-gray. ... Sometimes the Northern Lights are even present but not visible to the naked eye.</p>
			</div>

		
		
			<div class = "about">
				<h3>How long do the Northern Lights last?</h3>
				<p>10 minutes
				12. How long do the northern lights last? Anywhere from 10 minutes to all night long, depending on the magnitude of the incoming solar wind. "Coronal holes" consistently produce nice auroras but big solar flares and CMEs-coronal mass ejections are responsible for global-wide aurora displays…the BIG shows!</p>
